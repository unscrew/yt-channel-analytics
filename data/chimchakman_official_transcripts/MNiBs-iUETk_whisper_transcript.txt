I guarantee that was the best day of his life He definitely could get pretty war like from time to time I'm just gonna make this occasionally No, that it does This is the plan I've been working on this for a long time I'm just gonna go to the bathroom Let's go to the toilet Let's go to the toilet Holy, there's a gentleman Come on, we have to hurry A gentleman? David told us to come here We gotta get through He's waiting for us There's no more time to lose Holy shit, come on, let's go Don't be safe here, don't worry I don't know what to believe in When I was living in a club, I felt like I was in a depression When I was in a club When I saved the life of a club, I was in a hurry I was in a very physical state I don't think I'm in a normal state But I don't know what to do I think I can do it for the top We're gonna fix this together He's serious, David You know we can't let this go He's been ordered to be a peaceful community sending your men to murder and loot Rady John, is this true? He's pointing the finger at everyone First badger, now me You're so serious, aren't you? Just low life was part of the rates Ah! Let me go I need to go to work I need to go to work I need to go to work And then I'm gonna go back to my place The real question is how could I not? What would happen to us without your fertilizer Clint? Or your pills, Paul? Do you think our community would survive? I did what I had to to ensure that we would It wasn't easy If you had such good reasons If you had such good reasons If you had such good reasons I took the hard decisions on myself All of you remember the winter How much we lost We lost our tail We were going to take the tail We had to attack the water We didn't do that We were going to die Didn't you try to eat it? I made a promise I would never let that happen again The raids were just to keep us going Till Richmond reached the standard of the road Why don't we go to the other warehouse? It's so close to our door Do we really want to risk it all by fighting amongst ourselves? We should all be on the same side of this David On Richmond's side She's fucking delusional Building a dream on the blood of innocents We lost money on it to those raids How many others lost their kids too? It's a bit like a little bit of a life-saving It breaks my heart about your child It's something I'm going to have to live with Take them What the hell? Put them in a cell until I can figure out what to do with them They're all going to die What? Why? Why aren't you coming? I can't do this until I can do it I can't do this If you don't come back, you can't do it I already ate it when I saw it I ate it twice, and it was 4,000 won What did you eat? I ate it with a banana I ate it all I'm going to use a max I'm going to use a max to get a shot I'll be using the decoration for playing this game I would've found the 24th floor If we have another camera, the guys might've learnt how to act It's ok? What for?
