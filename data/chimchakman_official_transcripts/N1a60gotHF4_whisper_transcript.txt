We're done here. I got to get your name, darling. Could you not have just took her there? Clementine. Can't imagine what you've been through Clementine. I'm looking after her until we find her parents. Hey, Dad. So I'm thinking... First thing tomorrow... We got to reinforce the fence around the barn. He's so green, degrin, no? So green, degrin. I don't know what you saw on TV or heard on the radio. But there's some serious... Shit hitting the fan. I don't think anyone knows how big it is yet. Thanks, son. You're gonna want to fortify this place. Stuff like that doesn't happen around here, Sean. I'm serious. Come on. Tell him what you saw out there, man. How to wipe that out?

I'm a veterinarian back in Fort Lauderdale. Like Herschel here, except more with dogs and cats and not horses. What is it that you do, Lee? I used to teach up at the University of Georgia. We can go back to our jobs soon, Lee. Back to normal. It can't stay like this. No, I used to. I was like going to a wallbag. That's too bad. Well, I hear people always clamber back to college after a big disaster. People don't want to die ignorance, I guess. How did you handle getting through this city? Can you just drove? We passed so many people that needed help and we just passed people over some. Just... just... It's okay, it's fine. You don't have to say anything. I want to call you back. He even died. Now, you don't like the stars, do you? They're bad before. Bad now, but they're different, you see? People are eating each other. But they weren't before. The bags. The bag. They're all gone. I want to remember. I can't call you. I don't like the face, I'm a bit... Okay Lee. Oh, I'm a bit... I don't like the face. There's a ghost. I'm not a fan. You had to drive it? Sure don't. I can give you a hell of a critique of the US Farm Bill though. I'm good. Sean's still working on that fence. You're through so well. Hey Lee. Need a hand? That'd be great. If you could cut those two by the length, that sure speaks out. Okay, I'll just say. That means you won't stop doing it. Seems like you make it. I don't know, I don't hear.

I'm a commercial fisherman, catching macro, dolphin, whatever's biting and paying. 같이 안 하고 오셨죠. Catching would be wild about it but the boat's not that bad. See ya. boat. 오, 전해. 오, 여기 있다. 여기가 thingy. Hey, hey green. 타 있는데? You should know that if you weren't leaving with Kenny today, I wouldn't stand for your lack of honesty last night. I'm not sure I'll follow. How'd you get out of that lena? 오, 나를 안 믿고 있어. 차 타고. 아, on foot. I headed south and hooped it out of there. That's a long walk. This farm's a nice plot of land. 20 years ago I'd still be doing this. I would have told you that you were full of crap. Never was a plan. Having a place like this. It was in the family and I guess it was I. Family is in the war. I mean, I don't believe in that. That's right. Parents. Why, girlfriend? No family. I had a beta fish on my desk at the university. I hope someone remembered to feed him. But now you've got this little girl to take care of. Clementine, is it? You just stumbled up on her? This is because Clementine was right. I was being attacked and she came to my rescue. Hmm. Can I give you a piece of advice? This is not it. It's all done. I don't know who you are. But you better become a better liar and fast. Let's say things don't get better back in the cities. Or they get worse before they do. You're going to have to depend on the honesty of strangers if you're going to make it. And if those same people get the questioning yours, you're going to get in trouble. So whoever you are and whatever you are, you're going to have to be the one to get the questioning yours. But at least you have a common sense to listen to a man giving you advice. Go! I'll get my gun! What? No! No! No! No! No! No! I'm going to get my gun! No! No! I'm going to get my gun! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! I got you! I almost got you! Let me back off the beat! Please! Help me! Please! No! No! No! No! No! Get out of my way! Get out of my way! Don't come to me. Don't do that to me. I'm not going to get you. I'm not going to get you. Get the fuck out of here! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your son is alive. You don't get to be sorry. And you! You didn't even try to help. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. You did. That worked. You did. You did. This Earth atom of fire. Hellous of fire. This Earth atom… it has a sense of existence. You did. Oh, Oh Yeah. You did. You did. Wolf Sed 먹는'tn
