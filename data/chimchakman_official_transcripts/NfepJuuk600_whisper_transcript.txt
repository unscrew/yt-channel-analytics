I appreciate the interest. But I don't think talking about my feelings right now is going to help us get inside this house. You think maybe someone's still inside? Nah. We'd have heard from them by now, all the racket we're making. But whoever was here did a pretty good job fortifying it. And that's place to hold up. We can just figure out how to... We have to get in. To be them to the hall. How's it coming? To get in the way? To the middle of the tunnel. We're locked out tight. To have a de force it without making a whole lot of noise. Maybe there's a better way here. Well, if there is, I ain't seen it. Maybe you should have a look around. See what you can find. Okay. Can you... Can you tell me something? No, no. What's this? Looks like there's some kind of pet door here. I tried it already. That's locked to... No, this time, get the... Who the hell ever heard of a locked doggy door? I have. My neighbor had one just like that. It's radio controlled. What the hell is that? It's a shit in it. It's a school day. It's a school day. All right. So... Where's the dog? He's dead. Let's get him to the floor. If he gets to the floor, he can't get in. They are. There? They don't even know. There is a Vanguard exchanged now. The Vanguard was... They speak the Lyck abgesage right. That's what I've been told, because there's already investigation. Um... Asked the two players's questions only. Come through. Then you'll know the way. They just mentioned. Before making the call?

You and me will take the upstairs. Lee you got down here. Make sure you check every door, understand? Okay. Can I help? What if there's another locked door? I think you've been helpful enough for one day, kiddo. Why don't you just see if Kristen O'Meet need anything, okay? Okay. Okay. K.B. Holy. There's nothing. Why did you get out of here? Nothing. Water's off. I'm just gonna go for it. Water. I don't feel good. I'm not that easy to get out of here, but after I'm used to it, I don't get that kind of physical feeling. So, what's this body? It's easy to get out of here, but if you need to use your body, you can't move. This is human. If you get a little bit of it, it becomes a muscle reality. Just look at the picture and see if you can see it. It's a little bit of a muscle. Ah, so sad. But that feeling is... It's because you're confident. It's getting more and more. It's a little bit of a muscle. It's not like I'm talking about a little bit. It's like this. It's like this. I'm not that easy to get out of here, but it's like this. It's not that easy to get out of here. It's a muscle. It's like this. What should I eat? Let's go get two. I need to finish checking the downstairs. Honestly, I think I can eat the stairs. Didn't they eat the books? How's the camera going to blow? When I see the stairs, I like the light. The light is too far. I think I'm going to the tower. I think I'm going to get the time to do the information. It's not that far. I know we can't get in there. I know we can't get in there. I hope you're right. We can't get in there. They're talking about poop. I think they're family. I think they're really close to the dog. It's not exactly the last time. Lee likes graffiti. It's more like a graffiti than a painting. All clear and here. They told me that I trust the polished city pharmacist. What's wrong? I couldn't write it down. Right. 우리 안나오지 않나 WHAT HAPPIN'T 비켜 도르� Arabicispat 저런 상황이 100이면 배... 아! 아무나 이라uu 냐 dietary 시위하자 Vu 스팸 biblical 아, 오미트. 오미트, 정연아, 아깐. 준비한 70%? 준비는 기... 준비는 기... 준비는 기... 아, 그냥 다우크루. 그리고 좀 워스키, 그 바스키. 계사로 와, 위스키. I was just asking Clementine if she knows who the man on her radio is. It's okay, honey. You can tell us. Who is he? What does he want? 되게 집이 안 해 줘야죠. What has he been saying to you? What have you been saying to him? I just can't make a fool of him. I told him I was trying to find my parents and that they were in Savannah. He really seemed nice. I think he wants to help me find them. Clementine, honey. Trust me. That's not what he wants. Who is he? Lee! Who knows? Lee, you need to get up here now. What's wrong? It's Kenny. Hey, Kenny, are you asleep? Kenny said he thought he heard something up there. Went to go look. Kenny said he was asleep. Yes, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. What? I think I'll upload this. What? I don't believe in the middle. If you don't know who the middle is, there's a neighbor in the middle. Kenny? It's a middle. It's a middle. What are you doing? It's a tissue. It's a tissue. It's a tissue. I think I'm hungry. I think I'm hungry. I think I'm asleep. No, no. It's not a tissue. It's a tissue. It's a tissue. I'm okay. I'm okay. What's going on? What happened to him? Nothing happened to him. I don't know if I could do this. Not again. I can't ask you to go through this again. Let me take care of it. Are you sure? I guess we'll find out. Kenny? what the..! Giving it something. Ms. limp! Finally, it's his time to say hello! It's all busy eating because everyone around him eats bcs!usion Game lags Playing with other kittens What's this? He has a little bit of a bad feeling. Go get that bread. 어, 어쩔 수 없어요 어, 사람 있다고 무슨 의미가 있겠습니까? 어, 사람 있다고 무슨 의미가 있겠습니까? 어, 이 분이 개나 묻어주세요 오케이, 오케이 이 총알
