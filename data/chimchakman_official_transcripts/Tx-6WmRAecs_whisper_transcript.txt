There's so many dumbasses out there fighting each other these days. It's just stupid. How many people you got over there anyway? 9 including the kids. Well 10 actually if you count the new guy. Well we love to get you all out to the dairy. Like I said, we got plenty of food and quite frankly we could always use an extra help in hand.ните Drop el Beginno 그래pad enforcement Protossials 벌컨 방문ực 아, 너 guys would keep it it off for yourself What do you mean, dude?

I'll keep looking around. All right. Keep me posted. Too bad it's broken. I'll bet Clementine and Duck would have loved something like this to play on. Kids used to like that old swing even more than the tour sometimes. I'll bet. When was the last time it got any use? Been quite a while. I don't exactly have a lot of kids visiting anymore. I'll look forward to the day when kids can just be kids again. Amen to that. Looks like it just needs a new board for the sea. Some rope. They could save for Clementine and Duck. And let the same giant know we can pull our way to round here. You can just cut this. You can just cut this. We can do our best. We can do it. This rope is perfect for the swing. This rope is perfect for the swing. Nothing else I need in here. Uh, sparse, don't. This dairy went a lot of ribbons in its day, huh? This place was my daddy's life. Everything to him. You know, when he first bought this place, it was a single story house. Is that right? After us kids was boring, he insisted on adding a second floor. Said they had to have room for as many babies as they could have. Mama, she was done after Dan. My folks stopped after two was well. Then one day, the world changed. Now this place is all we have left to daddy. That's why we take such a good care of it. Why we want to share it with good folks like yourselves. Well, how are they, Lee? What can I do for you, sweetie? Can I help you with anything around the house? I think with Dan, he's helped us. I think he's pretty well-squared away in the kitchen. But feel free to check with Andy. He's got a lot of weight on his shoulders these days. So I'm sure he'd love any help he can give. Okay. The family is done an amazing job keeping this place up. No, aren't you sweet. Thank you, Lee. The boys and I have tried to adapt. That best we can. But we still keep some of our old routines to help remind us of better times. What happened to the rest of your staff? Oh, we've had our share of tragedy here. Just like everyone else. I'm sure. But my employees don't have any family members. So this may hurt the news. The few that step around, and I lost most of them the first night. Those things showed up here. It was tough. Not too many rooms. Does this house have room? Room? Why do you have? The books custom built. Not so cute to know this. My husband put a lot of work into this old house. Well, he did a fantastic job. I believe in making a house out of home. When will dinner be ready? It'd be a while still. But it'd be worth it. Trust me. How's your family been hold up since, you know? My parents had been my sleeping friends. They both left their jobs and came home to help out after the attack started happening. I think it was hardest, don't they? Dan was always more of a mama's boy. But don't help him. Dan looks very dark. Dan's been working hard. Why are we all so appreciated? No problem. But he said he was a rookie. He could have been a rookie. For sure. I can hardly wait for dinner. You want to go out? For sure. I can hardly wait for dinner. If you die right away, If you die right away, you'll be ready. If you eat it with your own hands, If you eat it? If you eat it, you'll die if you die. But you'll be free. You'll regret it. If you regret it, you won't eat it. What's that? Generator. You guys come along with gas just in time. Hey, don't mess with that, okay? The thing's a little tricky. I don't want to spend half a day trying to fix it again. Hi. Hi. Well, I'm glad you guys decided to help us out. I noticed back in Motel that folks are pretty well-armed. Been stockpiling, huh? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The electric fence is enough to keep out walkers. Walkers? Is that what you call them? Walkers. We were in Buggis. 다른 사람들이 농자에 걸어 있다는 것을 알게 된다. 굉장히 불기란 데 이거. 살려서 아니, 사람들이 왔다 갔는데 없었던 것처럼 처음부터 없었던 것처럼 너무 그리고 일단 평화로운 분위기를 만든 거 자체가 만성도 license י 니들 몰 18 야만 마트 플라트 화ason Cover 화사conomic 막ой 아 나 죄송합니다. 지제실 뻔했네 이제 봐봐 만, 진석도 화성 Lum��oy pareceями Missouri之ises를 감지하는 dictatorship 당 Selbst이 이제 이자도Some거 bueno, 이때가 네 little help here Lee if you're waiting for that guy to help, it ain't gonna happen come on Lee Holy fuck! what just happened?
