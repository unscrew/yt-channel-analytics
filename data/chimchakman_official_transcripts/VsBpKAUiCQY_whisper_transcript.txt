I was trying to get in and help her. She started yelling and saying I was bitten. I tried to convince her I wasn't. And that's what all these guys came out of the forest. A couple almost got me. And I ended up hiding in the ice machine. Lucky you. Now let's go. We can't just leave her. Damn right, we can't. You guys are so suicidal. Over a girl. I'm saving her with or without you.
