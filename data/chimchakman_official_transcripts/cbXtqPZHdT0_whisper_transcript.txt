Look, I know I'm probably not the best person to talk to about that stuff before. You weren't that bad. Thanks for, you know, being here. Basically, all this means is you could become a mom if you want it. Funny. I already felt like a mom. Kenny used to say I was a natural born mother. Kenny and I were born with that when Kenny broke up with me. I was born with my own way. It's a butterfly. Good boy. Want another? Which one to do next? How about... Hey, baby. 내가 토끼는 몰라. 그는 여기잖아. He's at our dinner. That's a pretty good wrap. What a lie. Always used to do that one for Doug. He laughed his ass off. Oh, shit. Hey, grab the lighter out the duffer, will you? Kenny, you're not doing it? I did. Get up and fight. Hey, just a second, good boy. Kenny, you're not doing it. I don't think it's a light. I guess I should go and get some. I think I should go and get some. Yeah, mom always put in him first. You've done as much for AJ as I have. Rebecca would be grateful for you, too. Yeah, but you're the only mama he's got. Ah, I'm sorry. I was just going to die when I was in the same car. I think I did. Thank you for your age. Thank you for your $1,500. That kind of love. You're just a good man. I've been thinking. Snow use survival out here, hoping that Wellington will take us in someday. I bet we find some good people down in Florida. Maybe even a little friend for this goofball. Wouldn't that be nice? We could use the company. Hell, I know I could. AJ could use a friend his own age. I remember when you and Duck used to color together back at the motel. Helped him forget about all this. There's no way he could trust you. I'm sorry for all this sappy shit. I guess I'm just happy. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die in the same car. I'm about this one, little man. I think Kenji is going to die. I'm not going to die. But Kenji is not going to die. Who would die if he dies? Kenji is going to die. I'm not going to die. Who is the boy? Who is the boy? I am. What happened wasn't easy for any of us. You have to give AJ back, please. He needs me. I need him. That's just not going to happen, plan. Look, it's not much, but here. I think this is a no brand. I don't have any products. I don't have any products. There's no one else. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die. I made me feel worth a damn. You're going to die in the 12th? I can't believe you can die. AJ is helping me. He's still with you. Here. Don't think I'm going to die. I think she's going to die. You're a tough kid. She's like a good kid. You're screwed. You're going to be okay. Thanks, Eva. Good luck out there, Eva. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Who's going to die? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you think? I'm getting better. I know you want. Add it to the pile. I owe you one. Add it to the pile. Are you coming? I still have to ask Lingard about AJ. What are you doing at that time? Hello, Clementine. J.S. I thought you were rotting in a cell with David. Any chance he got out too? I hate to think about what J.S. might do to him. Despite all her pleasantries... She's just like a cruel bitch. J.S. I haven't seen him since. I'm not cruel enough to be a cruel bitch. He's not getting out. She doesn't know anyone. She's just like a cruel bitch. Why do you care if David got out? He deserves what's coming to him. If you think that, you don't know David. I know he's the reason I lost AJ. When AJ recovered, David was the one who stepped up to personal responsibility for that kid. You say that like it's a good thing. I really doubt he was a positive influence. David's the reason the kid's bed off now. And he's ever been. You can be as mad as you want. But how? How the things pan out. You thought too much? The fact of the matter is... David's been good for AJ. Among others. As a doctor, I'm telling you... He's in better shape now than when I first saw him. At least I never gave up on him. I'm sure his hell not going to start now. I stand by what I said. If David's taken such good care of him, why did he tell me to ask you where AJ is? That's what this is about then. You... You want to know where the boy is? I'm thinking about it. Is it a promise? If you do this, tell me. Why do you want to die? When your brother found me... Right? I guess you did well. But why don't you tell me where he is? Why don't you tell me? You should have done it. Bobby, I have to know. I've been looking for too long. What would happen if I saved you? Should I save you? No! Avi, how could you? So be it. It's your funeral. Especially now... I got that. Now that Jones is rounding up all the legit traders... He better... Hope she doesn't fight you. Hang in there, buddy. It's a crisis. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to go out. Thanks for the warm welcome. Just surprise the CEO is all. Oh, hell. You okay? Yeah. Kate's lying down in the other room for a bit. No, I've already got one. She's so cute. Thanks. I'll see you soon. I'll see you soon. You're welcome. I'll see you soon. Thanks. Thank you. I'll see you soon. I'll see you soon. human � prevfen 근데 얘네는 기분 안 나는데 얘네는 기지 말자, 얘네 순심할 때마다 내 주팡대로도 할 말 없어 Joan and her people are going to be at the square Right? We need to bring the fight to them We go after Joan, our problems are soft Great So... How do we do that?
