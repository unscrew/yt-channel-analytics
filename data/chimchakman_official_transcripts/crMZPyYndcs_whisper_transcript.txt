 эти 이데 WE 오, 네. 어, about that. 이러버렸냐? I'm just kidding. Here you go. 좋아. 아이고, 죄송. 죽은 사람의 한명도 없네. What's that? Nothing. Nothing. You can quit with the ag mother. I know you're from Crawford. What? Who told you that? I saw you on a security tape. Why'd you lie to me? I said there were stories about Crawford. I never said that's how I knew about it. I never lied to you. And even if I did so, what? I don't owe you anything. You saved my life twice, but you can't tell me the truth. Are we really going to do this now? I can set up to you. I used to live here with my sister. She was fortunate to have you. She was 14 years old. She started walking in Crawford. She was a very good real at first. She was like a pretty good real at first. We were safe. We had everything we needed to survive. We were all living here. No one who couldn't justify their place or their keen. No one who required special care. I know what I said. My sister was diabetic. And by Crawford's rules, that made her liability. I kept it a secret. I kept her safer as long as I could. But in the end, I couldn't protect her. That's not how I was. Crawford, they always talked about how their system worked. How anything was better than becoming one of them. But I saw what they'd already become. I just wish I could have seen it before it was too late. Before they came and took my sister away. This is all I have left of her. I didn't have time to take her away. I just wanted it, okay? It's okay, mommy. I understand. What the hell? I think that's our cue to get the hell out of here. What if we get to get to get to get to the hell out of here? I think that's our cue to get to hell out of here. When we get 16 years old, we're going to eat something. 아, 뭐... 아, 아니구... 그전에... 그 나타나야겠지... 그지, 선천성... 그런게... 이겼어, 그지... 오, 팁! Sorry, sorry! I just got spooked by those bells! And then I heard someone coming! What the fuck are you doing out here? Kenny and I still can't get the door open to the armory. He set me out to look for something we can use to bust it open. I found this! That's why... Then... where did you get that? I just found it! It was stuck in the door handle at the end of the hallway. Shit! Oh, no... Shit! Oh, no! Shit, I can't get out of here. Where's the other way? Lee! Shoot this fucker! Cakes! It wasn't me! Go in, kid! Nice! Oh, thanks! I'm sorry. I didn't get it. What the fuck is going on? They're coming. Oh, shit! Man, I don't hold them. Sir, but now how do we get out? Through the armory! We can just get this damn door open! C'mon, damn you! This isn't the fault! All I've fault! Tells me what I'm talking about. Man, we've talked about this. No, wait. I want to know what he meant. What do you mean this is all your fault? Come on, come on, what you mean? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, man. Kid! It's not the best time! Whatever you did, save it for later! Man, it's just the fucker! Fuck you, Lee! I can't do this anymore! It's been me all along, putting all of us in danger. Kacha and Dukkha. It was all me. It was all me. God, what? Wait a minute. What are you saying? It was me who made the deal with the bandit at the motor end, slipping them supplies. I thought maybe I could keep them off our backs. When it got discovered, that's when they attacked. And that's when Dukkha. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Kid, enough! Calm down, man! You little bitch! You're fucking dead! You hear me? Dad! My wife! The child! You got to both fucking kill! Kid, I said calm the fuck down! Calm down, man! Calm down, man! Calm down, man! Nice group you got here. Not that time, Molly. If this asshole thinks he's getting on my boat, after what he did, he's out of his mother fucking mind! Kid, he will sort this out later. After we get out of here, okay? Nothing to sort out. I just told you the way it's gonna be. The boat's not big enough for all of us. Somebody's gotta get left behind. Might as well be this piece of shit right here. Well, I wrote we leave him. I'm sorry, Ben. I know you mean well. But all I want to do is get back to Ome. He's got a lot of things to do. Don't keep that up. Don't I get a vote? Of course you do. He's my friend. He's my friend. Right. We don't need friends behind you. But... That's my own. I know you're gonna die. On second thought, I think I'm gonna upstairs. Why? Why do you have to vote here? I'm sorry, Ben. I've got to do what's best for the group. That means cutting you loose. I want to kill you. What about the rest of us? Don't we get a... Now can we go? Damn right. Vernon, come on! Let's go. I was in front of you. I was in front of you. You're gonna get a penalty, aren't you? You're gonna get a penalty? You're gonna get a penalty? I'm gonna get a penalty. I'm gonna get a penalty. You're gonna get a penalty? I'm gonna get a penalty. I'm gonna get a penalty. I'll just play with you. Wait! Good job. I'm gonna get a penalty. Where's the goal? I'm gonna get a penalty. I'm gonna get a penalty. Who's gonna get a penalty? Me? Who's gonna get a penalty? Let's go together. You're gonna get a penalty. Get a penalty. Next. You. Get a penalty. Next. Get a penalty. What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? Come on! It's all right, Klai. I'm fine. Any way out of here? This leads to the roof. We might be able to find a way down from there. You didn't come into town from the railroad, did you? Yeah. Why? I can see the sewer we came in from here. I think we can do this. Well, what are we waiting for? Go! Go! Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! The last one is the middle. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Who's open? I've got you. Climb up. Come on, you can do it. There's no time. You have to go now. Look at around, bitch. Come on. Let's go, damn it. Get Clem and the others out of here. Clem! Let's go, let's go. Okay. Okay, let's go. I'm sorry. But I don't have a car anyway. I don't have a car. I don't have a car anyway. I don't have a car. I'm sorry. It's a pain. It's a pain. I tried to do well. I didn't have any bad intentions. Christa? Everything okay? I tried to do well, but I didn't do it. I didn't do it because I had to adjust them. But since I don't have a car in my boat. Christa, don't! Stay back! I never should have left you. I'm so sorry. Christa, get away from him. I survived. Hey. Back already? We got you medicine. Good. I feel like I could use some. Where's Ben? He didn't make it. What happened? Dumb son of a bitch nearly got us all killed. At least stepped up and did what he had to. That's what happened. Nice to go on asshole. I'll take you. I did what I had to, but I don't expect Clementine to understand that. Hey, I don't want to understand it. You did the right thing. Trust me. I don't have a sense of shame. I'm going to go start work on the boat. If it's not related to the subway, okay, with a little luck you should start feeling better pretty soon. I'll stay here for a few more hours to check on. Let me know if you need anything. Thanks, Doc. Yes. Thank you so much. I'm going to sleep. Maybe now is a good time for you and me to have a little talk in private. Okay. Listen there. About what happened to Bri. Don't beat yourself up over it. It was nothing you could have done. You want to know the worst part? What? I don't feel much. I mean, I don't feel enough. Should not be broken up over what happened to me. I was my daughter. My daughter is my friend. She's my friend. She's my friend. It's like I just found out. But I think it's a good thing to think about that. It's like this is what our world is. We are just looking for you. What did you want to talk to me about? I know you care about Clementine. Anyone can see that. And I know you want what's best for her. With this plan of yours, putting everyone on a boat with no destination. Do you really think that's her best chance of finding somewhere where she can be safe? Because I don't. So I want to make you know her. I was on the time. What kind of an offer? I'll take her off your hands. Take her back with me to my people. Well, well supplied, well hidden. And a lot of us are far from her. And now, Klaus fallen. We got nothing left to fear from them. She'll be safe with us. Safer, then she will be if she stays with you. I promise you. That's what you want for her. Isn't it to be safe? I'm going to pretend you didn't say any of this and give you a chance to walk away. But you want to do it right now. And if you were her real father, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'm the main character. If you're with her, you'll be the one who's the most beautiful. And I will. You're the one who's like you. I'll take her back. I'll take her back with me. Anyone who tries to get between me and her. Anyone! It's going to wind up bad. Do you hear me? Take your hands off me. Don't wake up in the middle of the night. Hey, what are you doing? Yeah, I'm about to head out. I just want to say thanks. I'm going to be a bot. You're a bot. I think I'm just taking it. I don't know. I know. Yeah, I've been thinking it over. It's not for me. It sounds like it'd be pretty crowded. And I never did like the water. I'm sure. I've always done better on my own anyhow. Listen, I'm not much for goodbyes. Tell the others for me. Sure. You take care of yourself, Miami. You too. No, that's not it. The thing about the clementine is that it's not about getting caught up in the special emotions. I just want to protect you. The pain is the same. The woman who's been protecting you. Nothing to do with luck. It's the same for the four of us. I said I wanted to be a bot. But I still... Is it because you're going to be a bot? Or is it because you're a bot? I know. I was just thinking about it when I first started. But I'm good. I don't think I can do anything. I'm not saying I'll be a bad bot. What do you mean? What did you say? He knew we were running out of time. And that saving him might put everyone else in danger. So he told me to leave him behind so the rest of us could get away. It's hard to know that's difficult to understand. I understand. You do? Yeah. He thought about other people before he thought about himself. My mom always told me that's what makes a good person. That's right. He's right. But actually, there are people who are weak. When you look at the news, you can see the main character. Like a clam. Really? You'll take me to Crawford so we can look? I knew you didn't really mean it. I'm sorry, Clothetite. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? I just ate the crab. I'm sorry. Clothetite? What's that? Clothetite? Clothetite? Clothetite? 맞지? 오빠 차 뽑았다 널 데리ructor 네. 왜 집에 살암�anci 모르겠어? 두상 salary 사 son inchesuca 아, 물었네? 어... 아, 물었네? 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 물이 이거 숨겨야겠다 아, 물었네? 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어... 어차피 너랑... 나 혼자 하는 게 날뻔 나 어차피 감염됐고 뭐야 엉그맨 그리고 나 Rica 박고하자 내가 너가 울 Phantom member? 그러니까 나를 yolk рав에 이거're... 우리 둘 disability?! 한국사� mammals fighting among those families 아니 man! 나 통 discseok이 �σε 비� duplicate 물고�ube 무슨 부분을 물고있을 거냐 VO 캔이 우리 있네 응? 캔이 우리 있어 고맙다 캔냐 더 밖에 없다 이거 쭉 뻥 차력을 대론η 왜 떠났을까? 근데 너는 왜 숨김? 시즌 1 때 얘 죽나봐 죽지 않을까? 클레멘트는 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 클레멘타임 중심으로 한다고 그러잖아 시즌 2에 스포다 해서 에피오오 끝날 때쯤은 죽겠지 저한테 존기한테물 면을 무조건 죽어 너무 좋더라 클레멘트 타임 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 아이창이 어떻게 future? 그럼은 fundingês Ire고 배우 조심하려구요 너희 사장님을 뒀으니 보이? 주기 왔을 거냐고? 뭘 주겨? 에틱 에틱에서 번원 번원 거짓말 그때 딱 들어갔을 때 어... 그 짓말 안 하나가 그리고 크로포드에서 클레멘 타인을 데려가겠냐 보통 이제 데려간다고 하고 죽일 거냐 어? 다 안 죽일려고 했네? 그리고 물린 거를 어... 다 말한다고 했네? 물린 걸 다... 나 좀 약간 반대로 한 게 맞네? 아, 달학방에서... 꼬마에! 꼬마에! 그렇지 내가 죽여야지 캐념트 죽이라고 할 수는 없자 나와 함께한 그룹 분들 어? 살릴 수 있어서? 아, 얘 살릴 수 있었나 봐 그리고 할배는 무조건 죽는 거인가 봐 할배는 아예 없거든 저기? 할배는 무조건 죽는 거고 보니까 이제 배는 살릴 수 있나 봐 혼자 가는 것도 있었네 오미드 이렇게 해서 근데 같이 가면 뭐가 좋지?
