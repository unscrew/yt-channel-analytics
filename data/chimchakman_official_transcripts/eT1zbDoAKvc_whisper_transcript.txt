Hold on, we need to get on the road as soon as possible. We leave it first line. Whoa! Whoa! What are you talking about? Rebecca needs rest. A few days at the least. We've got that baby form. We won't help the rest of us. Now what about Shelter? We'll freeze out here. Can he's right? We should leave in the morning. Rebecca is in the end. Can't let him go. Condition to travel.
