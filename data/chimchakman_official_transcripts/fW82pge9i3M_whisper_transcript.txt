Now then, I'm not going to shoot not unless you made me. I just want to talk. You got me. Just want to have a word. What? So talk. Okay then. You, the two guys there, the kids, the women in the car, I saw you split up. I overheard that. I don't even know how close I am. Your friends are so close to me. Right. You folks have your shit together. They're good people. They've lost. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. Sure. We all have. Recently. I think I can trust you. I don't think I can. I don't want to talk. That makes sense. You're going to Richmond. That tells me you guys are going to Richmond. What's going on down there? Question is, who's sorry you want? Look man. I don't know who you are. I'm scared of the bank. He's so strong. Don't move. Don't move. I think he's a good guy. What? You see one of them? Hey man, what do you mean by them? Who's them? You know what I'm talking about. The new frontier. What? No, I'm not with those guys. You got this backwards. Bobby, this guy's full of donkey shit. Let's go to the store. Let's go to the store. I don't think he's with you. I'm sorry. Let's go to the store. Oh, the frontier. Did you see the old man? What did you say? What? How did he go there? What? What? What's that? What's that? If that's the good way to go. What? What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? What? If you go to the store, I'm sorry. What are you talking about? I don't think it's good to be a spoiler. I don't know the standard. I'm different from others. I think it's okay. If you say it, don't do it. Because you're the only one who eats. You're the only one who eats. I just want to share a good information. I'm a fan of you. I'm happy. I'm happy. It's all right. It's all right. Don't cry. I won't let you go. Don't say that you're going to live in the house. We're going to wait for them to go. And then we're going to find you some dinner. Hopefully, find us some dinner. Kim Tan-hul, Kim Tan-hul, What are you talking about? Let me in! Please! God, we're so bad. Please, don't leave me out here. Oh, shit. Hey there. Hello. Hello. If you want to see me, if you feel better, but if you shoot me, you'll have to deal with all of them. What a big group of them out there. But it'll pass. Eventually. Stop talking. Do what I say. And you might survive this. Yes, ma'am. Shit! Actually, the thing that breaks my head is that I can't even live. I can't live like this. God, dammit! Well, I'd say we make a pretty good team. Two of us. Three of us, I mean. Yes. You're a really good dancer. I'm a really good dancer. I think of that dancer. I'm old enough to put a bullet in you. Whoa! Take it easy. I'm not looking to make enemies here. You're a really pretty woman. We were out there scouting. Nothing out of the ordinary. And then... Chaos and... Shit. Those bastards are slow, but God... The real one's head is pretty. I got separated from the others. God, I hope they all made it. What are you doing these days? What do you think? Oh, sir. Do you know DJ? The new frontier is not that big of a deal. I'll have to go with you. Oh, I'm sorry. The world does work in mysterious ways. Let's do this. But I've heard you can get through. You can go through. What's going on with the idea of A.J.? Very well. How did you get through? What? I'm making a mess. How did you get through? I was one of them. I'm sorry. I heard you were with those monsters. I guess I'm the one who's a bad group. And I thought I didn't need them. But they were very persuasive. Who was a mistake? And so was not telling you about it. Tell me you're not still one of them. No way. Believe me. I just had to explain because if they're really in control in Richmond, I can't let them see me. I just can't. So when we reach the other side of this tunnel, I'm leaving. You're planning on joining us? Shh. I'm going to get a drink. Can you see that? Isn't it the first time you're coming? I'm not good at it. They're everywhere. Fuck. They are. Keep sharp. What are you doing? Why are you here? Why don't you talk to me? Why are you in a hurry? I should watch you separately. I can't talk to you about you being a fool. It's so good. Come here. Why are you so good? What is this? It's like a movie. Follow me. Tang. Follow me. Tang. You're standing here. I'm going to get a drink. Wow, crazy. Hey, can you do something like this if you're in a hurry? You can do something like this. Don't be too close. Don't be too close. Hey, you're going to get a drink? Tang. I'm going to get a drink. I'm going to get a drink. Why? Why? I'm going to kill the Conrad. I'm sorry. Red, you... You didn't need to be so important to your voice. I'm sorry. I can think of it as a selfishness. I'm sorry. You're the one who's always in charge of your voice. You're the one who's always in charge of your voice. I'm sorry. If you're a hero, and you're the one who's just a enemy, you're the one who's just a enemy. I'm sorry. I'm going to get a drink. Why are you doing this? You're going to get a drink. I'm not doing this. If you want to shoot me, shoot me. How about I shoot you low boyfriend here and stay? If you don't let him, he's going to get a drink. I'm going to get a drink. This is how it's going to be. And then we all step into the sunshine. Come on, man. Be reasonable. This helps both of us. I'm just going to go. Conrad is ready. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's wrong with you? You're not bad. Where did you learn this? I don't want to kill Conrad. Because of me. Conrad's... You're a dead friend. You're a fucking coward. A fucking coward. What are you doing? How could you? I'm not a dead friend. I did this for Kate. For us. But what about Clam? What about Clam? She's not safe. She's just a bit sick. I was just talking to her when I was in the middle of the night. Just fight her. If you're safe. No, I'm going to get a drink. Clam is not safe. I'm not going to get a drink. I was just talking to her. You know? I'm not going to get a drink. But Conrad's dead. Conrad is dead. But I can't get a drink. She's overreacting. Like hell, I am. If you just take a deep breath here, she's new frontier. Has been all along. They're going to be real happy to see her again. I put money on it. He's not wrong. This could be useful. Right now, we need to find Kate now. You're right. Let's move out. How can I get a drink? The gates are this way. If your people are here, that's where they would end it up. Don't say anything. Why is it so quiet? I thought there'd be new frontier marching in the streets and shit. Practicing on walkers or... Whatever the fuck they do. It does seem strangely quiet. Maybe we just got lucky. Trust me. They're out there. I'm not sure if I can get a drink. But I'm not sure if I can get a drink. I'm not sure if I can get a drink. I'm not sure if I can get a drink. I'm not sure if I can get a drink. What's the hell? What's the hell? Why are you saying you're gonna get a drink? Is that action-based thing? Oh, fuck. Did they see us? I don't think so. Can you see anything, Harvey? What are they doing? They're really like a forest. Is that what you're talking about? That's their car! They're playing games with us. They're looking at the ceiling. K? K, can you hear me? K, talk to me. Say something. Talk to me. Harvey? Yes. You're not going to go like this? I could really use something to take the edge off right about now. Let's go to the gym again. Very funny. I've been saving it for a while. K. You're playing games? I'm almost a zombie. I'm a zombie. I should be a zombie. I'm not sure if I can say this, but I'm a zombie. I'm almost a zombie. I'm not a B-in. I'm thinking Kate's not going to make it much longer. So it's time we walk up to the front door and say hello. That means we're doing this my way? It might. But so we're clear. You follow my lead until our people are safe. Understood? Bye. Here we go. Kate wants someone to meet us and invite us to the P rid List. Then he'll tell you what. 아 이거 죽는 사람은 안 되던데 아 이거 죽는 사람은 안 되던데 아 지금 좀 좀 비웃까지 됐다 지금 뭐 Would you say this somewhere warmer 좀 좀 비웃까지 됐어 If you want to stay behind I wouldn't blame you Hey This is where I was going in the first place But Yeson just slept here Hey There's another one What the hell No, no No matter how much I'm in the store She needs medical care Why do you have one of our people? Uh-huh What's your point? Sorry Why are you taking revenge on me? No, I didn't go to the hospital All right, you have my attention But I'd be lying if I said I was convinced What do you want to do? Go get the boss You don't get him, you? He's gonna want to see this Now all of you Lower your weapons Not a chance Maybe a good idea to play the boss He's a punitive chocolate, at least for now You put him down I'll see that as an expression of good faith Nice and easy But if you don't put him down, you can't get him If you don't put him down, you can't get him down You don't have to fight If you fight, you can't get him down What the hell is going on out here? They said they weren't here to hurt anyone So I was trying to see if they... Oh my god Did I...? Did you see the J-20? Oh, you're going to end here? No, you're not going to end it, right? Oh my god So you were the one who was the one who got the most attention Why did you become the one who got the most attention? What is this? You did the D Did you say you did the D D? Did you actually say that? Did you say you wanted to leave the table when you were told to leave the table? I said that So I was told to leave the table I was told to leave the table when you were told to leave the table How did you end the game over the table? I was told to leave the table when you were told to leave the table Did you do it as you did? I think this is what it looks like I gave up I gave up And these people I gave up These people What is T8 Who is that? Is it a gift for you to give up? And it's just a gift for you Oh, this is a gift Did I believe? Many people believed I was really fighting But I was so stupid I was watching the game I was like, I didn't think about talking I didn't know I didn't want to talk I thought that was not a choice I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was bad at playing with you What is that? flexacey 키스 제가 한 선택은 대부분 많은 경우가 많았고, 요게 좀 의외했네요. 근데 이거는 이 지상으로 맞죠? 말을 들어가던 거니까. 제가 한 선택은 대부분 많은 경우가 많았고, 요게 좀 의외했네요. 근데 이거는 합의에 입장해서 한 게 아니고, 이 유저들은 워킹데드 1, 2, 3를 해서 감정이 물 한 상태인 거죠. 클램에 대해서. 그래서 한 선택이라고 생각해요. 1, 2가 아니었다면 이렇게 치우쳐진 그 투표율이 나올 수가 없어요. 합의 입장에서는 클램이 이런이 저런해도 아직은 못 믿는 사람이고, 만난 지국, 얼마 한 달도 안 됐잖아. 한 달이 뭐야? 일주일도 안 됐을걸? 빼야 돼서 나하고 일주일도 안 됐지. 너 어떻게 믿어? 사실상. 그리고 콧레드한테는 내가 좀 마음의 빗을 신게 했고 그런 거지. 이 영화 사죠? 워킹데드는. 사실상 내 선택이 영향을 주진 않지만, 영화를 보는 느낌. 애니메이션을 보는 느낌이죠.
