He and Walter used to vacation here. He should be back soon. 음... 그럼, I wanted to ask you. Does Kenny seem different to you? I didn't know him before. And, well, I'm curious. He does seem different than I remember. In what way? I'm not sure. Well, you three have been busy? Kenny, Isn't it great? I got it. You want? I said I got it. It's the same. Always has to play the gentleman. But I'll tell you, when I met him, he couldn't live to fly. Why don't you go see if your friends are ready for dinner, Clementine? 사실, Kenny보다 클램이다 밖에 안 돼. Are you okay? Just got a little dizzy. I can't even take care of myself. How am I supposed to raise a child? I mean, how can anyone now? It's not gonna be easy. Good. It's okay. We're gonna get you something soon. Hey, Han-i. She's gonna be a runner. If he finds out it's not his, he'll kill me. I don't know what to do. I can't believe I'm asking a little girl for advice. But I guess nothing's weird anymore. I don't know what to say. There's my man. You alright, baby? What are you doing? You big dope. Just need to get some food in you. Thanks for staying with her, Clementine. Well, everyone, I'm... How can I change the dinner? Let's see. You okay, man? Yeah, I'm just... Mano-chateine, just a little bit. Mano-chateine. Just try to forget about it. Mano-chateine. Right here, Clementine. Can you sit with Ken? Here you go, Clem. She won't be here. So, Clem, we were just talking. What's the deal with the kid? What's his name? Luke? He in charge? You trust him? No clue. Can you please? Sarita, we don't know these folks. Luke is a good person. I like him. He's a good person. I like him. He's a good guy. Would you trust him with your life? I think so. Can you look back? Big Al. He said they were on the run. Some people are after them. Well, you don't have to worry about that no more. They'll go tomorrow and you can stay here. Absolutely. Honey, you stay with us as long as you want. Thank you. Of course. This is like a dream. Damn it. I am so happy right now. I can't even tell you. Do you think I'm acting like a movie star? What's the movie star? What was it? Was it Walter? Hey there. Hey. Hope you like the food. Oh, it's great. Thank you. Beaches and beings. Great for nutrition. Not too great on the way out though. I'll tell you. So it's Luke and Nick. Luke and Nick. You guys sure do look like a match. What's that supposed to mean? It's what I'm just saying. You look like it's friends. It's what it means. So what was your plan here? Hold out for the winner. Actually, we were thinking of moving on. Somewhere up north. You ever heard of a place called Wellington? Wellington? The hell is that? A place. What kind of place? A good one Einstein. Yeah. It's in the north. It's supposed to be a big can. Up near Michigan. Michigan? You got a hearing problem kid? Yeah Michigan. And that can't even. I can't even look under. It sounds like bullshit. Listen Vanilla ice. I don't know what your deal is. But your morn welcome to take off in the morning. Navi just fine by me. What's the deal with these guys, Clam? They fuck you buddy. It's fine Nick. We're not staying. She's staying. Luke listen to him. I have been. But. Can he's my friend? Gentlemen please. There's no need for this. Now look we've all had a long day. Please eat. Ask me that can duck. Duck? Who's duck? Kenny? Hey Clementine. Would you let me hand outside for a moment? You think you're confident. So you want to live with Clementine. You can really help me. I used to be a teacher. And I remember what it's like to be caught in the middle of two clicks. I suspect they'll find common ground soon enough. It may take a little time. But that's just how these things work. Everything will be fine. Listen relationships are like any machine. You don't throw them out when they break down. Yeah I was saying. People are more political now than they ever were before. In the end we can't change the world. All we can do is continue to learn from each other. To empathize and use our heads. All wars are just... Kenny is the only one who can't change things. Steinbeck. Have you read him? Well we have plenty of time to catch you up on your reading. My partner Matthew is amassing quite the literature clutch. I think you'll like him. In any case the point is, as long as we have our wits about us, we can always make the right choice. Right? Right. What's the matter Clementine? Is there something you want to tell me? You can talk to me, Claire. There's almost nothing you can do. What did you say to everybody that surprised me? I can promise you that. And that all the meanings on 어 그래서 내가 그리고 왜 이렇게 생각� hip 오� nearest 그냥입니다 어떻게 está 이�оздreet binds 신향이 아주 많다고 광고해 신향이 아주 많다고 광고 그리고 초당학교 상여이네 초당학교 상여이네 여기에서 초당학교 5학년 되겠다 오르크한거 초당학교 5학년 되겠다 초당학교 5학년 되겠다 오르크한거 초당학교 5학년 되겠다 초당학교 5학년 되겠다ㅋㅋ Allah [(onz forgot)] 아 bik ס Ron br saws 아 Youtube 눈치 없이 바라고 하시는데 근데 이 사람은 무슨 말이야? 룩스는 right You can't tell him Listen to her Okay It's fucking crazy Jesus I can't handle this I'm not a pain in the pain A pain in the brain Just go do that thing Alright Why are you crying?
